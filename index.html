        Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr, born October 20, 1971 in
        Long Beach, California, better known by his stage name
        Snoop Dogg, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, producer
        and actor. Snoop is best known as a famous MC in
        the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer
        Dr. Dre’s most notable protégés. He made his rap
        debut in 1992 on Dre’s first album The Chronic, and then
        released his own album, Doggystyle, to much critical
        and public acclaim. His mother nicknamed him “Snoopy”
        as a child, and he took the stage name Snoop Doggy
        Dogg when he began recording. He changed his name
        to Snoop Dogg in 1996 when he left his original record
        label, Death Row Records.

Through his friend Warren G, Snoop met famed rapper Dr. Dre, which led to Snoop's start in the music business. His first album, Doggystyle (1993), climbed its way to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's hip-hop and Top 200 charts, based in part on the success of the singles "What's My Name" and "Gin and Juice." His next album, Tha Doggfather (1996), also reached the top of the charts. He scored the top slot on the hip-hop charts with his next two albums: Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told (1998) and No Limit Top Dogg (1999). Snoop became known for his laid-back rapping style and his name has become synonymous with gangster rap of the 1990s. He originally called himself "Snoop Doggy Dogg," but later shortened it to Snoop Dogg.

Snoop continues to make music, scoring his last big hit with the single "Drop It Like It's Hot" in 2004, which reached the top of the hip-hop and pop charts. His 2006 release, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and the single "That's That Shit" received good critical response. In 2007, Snoop became the first artist to release a track as a ringtone prior to its release as a single, "It's The D.O.G."
The rapper has also branched out into acting and appeared in several films, including 2004's Starsky and Hutch. He has made several guest appearances on television shows, including "The L Word" and "Weeds", and starred in his own E! reality show, "Snoop Dogg's Father Hood", in 2007. The series features his wife, Shante, and their three children, Corde, Cordell and Cori.
